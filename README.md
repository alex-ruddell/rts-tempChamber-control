## Project Description
This project sees a program produced allowing a user to control the temperautre inside a plastic temperature chamber. A National Instruments Elvis Board hosts the temperature chamber system, consisting of multiple temperature sensors and actuation elements. Actuation elements consist of a heater and a fan, for rising and lowering the internal temperature of the chamber.
